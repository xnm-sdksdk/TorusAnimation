# Three.js Space Scene

This project utilizes the Three.js library to create a dynamic 3D space scene with a rotating torus, directional light, and stars. The scene responds to user scrolling, adjusting the camera position based on the scroll offset. Additionally, the project includes responsive handling for window resizing.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xnm-sdksdk/TorusAnimation.git
   ```

## Features

- **Rotating Torus**: The main element of the scene is a torus that rotates on its axis.

- **Directional Light**: A directional light source enhances the visibility and shading of the torus.

- **Starry Background**: A multitude of stars are randomly distributed throughout the scene.

- **Dynamic Camera Movement**: The camera position changes based on the user's scroll, creating a parallax effect.

- **Responsive Design**: The scene adapts to window resizing, maintaining the correct aspect ratio.
